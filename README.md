I decided to completely revamp this project after I realized p5js didn't support glsl es 3.00.

The goal is to make a simple, modular development environment with support:
1. include glsl code to avoid copy-pasta mess
2. allow extensibility of interaction with js and glsl
3. to create a simple declarative model of handling the webgl boilerplate

Still a wip...

Check out [demo.html](demo.html) for a rough idea....

Documentation at some point... lot to do...
